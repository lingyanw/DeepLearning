# DeepLearning Projects 
Projects:

--MINST

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

--MakeCircle_Boundry

Use N-layer deep neural networks to draw boundry in a 2-D data map. The goal is to draw a boundry between purple and red circles representing two categories. Handwritten backpropagation algorithms are used to practice math. 

--ComplexCell_Predict

Use deep neural network to capture and predict complex cell behavior. Theoretical background for this project is based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0517-x
